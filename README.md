## Progress

Currently brainstorming. Have come up with either a RPG story (like Undertale), Mad Libs Generator, "rock paper scissors", trivia bot (may add more).

Have decided that if we are making an RPG, we will only focus on the RPG because it is a long game and the outcome of the story will change with player input. BUT, if we are making a short game like "rock paper scissors", we will add several minigames. 

Minimum number of games are 3. 

We have a completed "rock paper scissors" code in our inventory already.

A "fast version" of rock paper scissors has been created. And is actually in working order! The feeling is phenomenal~

Trivia is in progress! Unfortunately, the Discord Bot has a limit of 20 reaction emojis so we will make a group for the list of categories. We have created 9 groups out of the 20 categories that we have.
